The whole earth,' said Pericles, as he stood over 
the remains of his fellow-citizens, who had fallen in the first year of the Peloponnesian War,-'the 
whole earth is the sepulchre of illustrious men.' All time, 
he might have added, is the millennium of their glory. Surely I would do no injustice to 
the other noble achievements of the war, which have reflected such honor on both arms of the service, and 
have entitled the armies and the navy of the United States, their officers and men, to the warmest thanks and the 
richest rewards which a grateful people can pay. But they, I am sure, will join us in saying, as we bid farewell to the dust of these martyr-heroes, that wheresoever throughout the civilized world the accounts of this great warfare are read, and down to the latest period of recorded time, in the glorious annals of our common
country there will be no brighter page than that which relates THE BATTLES OF GETTYSBURG.
